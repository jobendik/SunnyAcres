# Sunny Acres — A Farming Adventure

A cozy, browser-only farming/management game with procedurally generated
sprites, music, and SFX. Plant crops, raise animals, fish, run production
chains, deliver to a small town, and master the weather itself with the
signature **Weather Mastery Grid**.

Built in TypeScript, rendered with `<canvas>`, with **zero external game
assets** — every sprite is drawn at boot and every sound is synthesized
via the Web Audio API.

Live demo: **https://jobendik.github.io/sunnyacres/** (deploys automatically
on every push to `main`).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # development server at http://localhost:5173/
npm run build      # production build -> dist/
npm run preview    # preview the production build locally
npm run typecheck  # run tsc without emit
```

## Core gameplay loop

1. **Plow** grass → **plant** seeds → wait for growth → **harvest**.
2. Sell crops at the **Shop** or list them at the **Market Stall** for
   passive sales while you play.
3. Build **production buildings** (Feed Mill, Bakery, Hen House, …) that
   turn raw goods into finished products worth far more than raw items.
4. **Deliver** to local customers, the **Boat**, the **Train**, the
   **Balloon**, and the **Festival Cart** for big rewards.
5. **Specialize** at Lv 5 and start **casting Weather Cards** to bend the
   weather to your needs.
6. **Expand** your land (Lv 7+), build **Landmark** projects, join the
   **Farming Club** (Lv 15), and run **Expeditions** (Lv 16+) at endgame.

The first 10 minutes deliberately surface only the core loop. New systems
unlock and appear in the More menu as you level up — see
[`docs/system-fatigue-audit.md`](docs/system-fatigue-audit.md) for the full
tier breakdown.

## Signature mechanic: Weather Mastery Grid

Unlocks at Lv 5. Players craft **Weather Cards** (sunbeam, rainmaker,
thunderhead, marketwind, serenity, …) and slot them into a small
programmable grid. Activating the grid spends a daily charge and overlays
the chosen effects — faster growth, +sell prices, no crows, animal mood
floor, rare fish bias — for that activation's duration.

Cards can be **fused** with Weather Fragments (won from balloons,
expeditions, and obstacle clearing) into stronger composite cards.

## Technical architecture

- **Single mutable state**: `src/state.ts` exports a `state: GameState`
  singleton. Every system imports it and mutates fields directly.
  See [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts) for the full schema.
- **Zero dependencies**: gameplay, sprites, and audio all use vanilla
  browser APIs (`<canvas>`, Web Audio, `localStorage`,
  `requestAnimationFrame`). The only `devDependencies` are TypeScript and
  Vite.
- **Procedural sprites**: every visible asset is drawn into an offscreen
  `<canvas>` at boot via `buildSprites()` and cached. No image files.
- **Save**: serialized to `localStorage` under
  `sunnyacres-save-v3` with an internal schema version (currently v5).
  Timers are rebased on load so growth/production/boats/balloons/etc.
  resume cleanly across reloads and offline sessions.
- **Progressive disclosure**: `src/systems/feature-visibility.ts` is the
  single source of truth for which More-menu buttons appear at each
  level. New players see a small curated set; late-game players see
  everything.
- **Objective Rail**: `src/systems/objectives.ts` ranks the top 1–4
  next-best actions across every implemented system, surfaced at the top
  of the screen so the player always knows what to do next.

```

## Save / load

The game autosaves every ~20 seconds and on `beforeunload`. The save key
is `sunnyacres-save-v3`. Each subsystem's `init*()` function is defensive
against missing fields, so older saves load cleanly even after new
systems are added. Timer fields (crop growth, production jobs, boat
docking, expedition energy, contracts, balloons, visitors, …) are all
rebased by `Δt = nowSeconds() - saveTime` so offline progress resolves
correctly.

If you want to nuke a save during development:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('sunnyacres-save-v3')
```

## Debug helpers

Append `?debug=1` to the URL to expose `window.dbg` with helpers:

```js
dbg.coins(5000)     // add coins
dbg.xp(500)         // add XP
dbg.item('wheat', 50)
dbg.mat(5)          // grant 5× of every material
dbg.skip(2)         // skip 2 hours (advances boat/train/balloon/stall)
dbg.level(15)       // jump to a level for testing the unlock tier
dbg.refreshGazette()
```

These do not affect normal play.

## GitHub Pages deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `main`:
1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run typecheck`
3. `npm run build`
4. Publishes `dist/` via `actions/deploy-pages`.

Before the first deploy, enable Pages with **Source: GitHub Actions** in
**Settings → Pages**.

The asset base path is `/sunnyacres/` (configured in `vite.config.ts`).
For forks with a different repo name, set `VITE_BASE=/your-repo/` in the
workflow env or override in `vite.config.ts`.

## Controls

| Key / Gesture | Action |
| ------------- | ------ |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | Hand / Plow / Seed tool |
| Drag | Pan the camera |
| Scroll / Pinch | Zoom |
| Tap building | Open its panel |
| Tap crow | Shoo it away |
| `Esc` | Cancel placement / close modal |
| Tap ⋯ (More) | Reveal the level-gated system menu |
| Tap 📋 (Quests) | Open Quests & Orders side panel |

## Testing checklist

Manual smoke test for new builds:
- [ ] Fresh save: splash → tutorial spotlight on Plow → can plow, plant,
      harvest, sell, deliver an order, build a Bakery.
- [ ] Lv 1 More menu shows ≤ 12 items (no boat/train/club/prestige).
- [ ] Lv 5 More menu shows Grid + Path teasers / unlocked.
- [ ] Lv 10 More menu shows Boat (unlocked), Balloon (unlocked), Train teaser.
- [ ] Objective Rail surfaces a relevant action every 0.75s; no duplicates.
- [ ] Existing v5 save loads without console errors.
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass.

## Current status

The game is feature-complete for the Phase-1 through Phase-15 roadmap.
The most recent commit ("Visual + game-feel overhaul") added identity,
world polish, juice, and onboarding improvements. This pass adds clarity,
progressive UI disclosure, and a richer Objective Rail without removing
any systems.

The game is **intentionally code-generated and procedural** — no external
game assets, no CDN, no analytics, no network calls. It loads in under a
second and runs offline.

Real multiplayer (friend codes) is architecturally scaffolded but not
networked; the leaderboard and clubs use simulated peers.
